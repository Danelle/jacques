This document describes the format of jacques configuration file, which
is called JCONF.


JCONF is apache configuration format like. Below is a sample.

1    ListenPort 80
2    MaxPending 256
3
4    # This is comment
5    <ModuleA hello ALL> # This is comment too
6        You are  good
7        PutItOn
8    </ModuleA>


Every line in the configuration file is a logical line which has a
certain meaning itself.

For instance, line 1 'ListenPort 80' is divided
in two parts by one or more whitespaces. 'ListenPort' is the directive
name and 80 is the diretive value.

Directive name must only contain ascii letters, digits or underline,
and start with a letter. Just like variable naming convention in most programming language. And it's case sensitive too.

Directive value is much more optional. It can be empty or contain any
printable character, including whitespace.

Have a look at line 6. In this case, 'You' is the directive name and
'are  good' is the directive value. In line 7, 'PutItOn' is directive
name with a empty directive value.

JCONF supports directive group. In above example, '<ModuleA hello ALL>'
is the start of a directive group, and </ModuleA> is the end. The group
name is ModuleA and its optional argument is 'hello ALL'. The group name
follows the naming convention of directive name.

Directive group is recursive. A group can contain another group if
necessary.
